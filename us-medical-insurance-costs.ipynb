    "    8.03% of smokers being over the age of 60\n",
    "While I predicted that younger generations would have lower rates of smoking, this wasn't quite the case. While equal portions of each age group were smokers, majority of the smokers overall were between the ages of 30 and 60. Those over the age of 60 only accounted for less than 10% of total reported smokers. This, I think, might be due to the fact that smoking can contribute to health issues that would decrease one's overall lifespan. As a portion of smokers die at younger ages, they'd cluster in the mid-age range while their non-smoking counterparts would make up much of the patients in the oldest age group.\n",

    "For this section I wanted to see if average price differed based on a patient's sex, BMI, whether or not they're a smoker, and whether or not they have children. My predictions for this section are that women, on average, will have higher insurance costs than men, higher BMI's will lead to higher average costs, smokers will have higher costs, and those with children will have higher costs the more children they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sex, I believe this difference is possibly caused by women's need for more extensive healthcare procedures centered around reproductive health such as natal care. For BMI and a patient's smoking status, the difference I believe would be due to the higher rate of health complications found in those with higher BMIs and who smoke. When it comes to children, I believe the average will increase due to each individual child increasing the cost of medical care for a family."

On average, men's insurance was slightly higher than that of women while insurance costs for those with children actually peaked around 2-3 children with those having 5 children having the lowest costs over all.\n",
