    "Average Insurance Cost by Age\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the age groups, those 60 and older reported the highest average insurance cost at 21,063, next were those between the ages of 30 and 60 who had an average cost of 14,528.72. Those under the age of 30 had the lowest average cost at only 9397.55. This is in line with my prediction from before, with average insurance cost increasing as the age bracket increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average BMI by Age\n",
    "\n",
    "Average BMI for each age group was 29.89, 30.89, and 32.44 for young, middle, and elders respectively. While I was right in my prediction that average BMI would increase across each group, the difference was not nearly as wide as I predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentage of Smokers by Age\n",
    "\n",
    "Those 60 and older reported the highest percentage of smokers, with 24.18% of them reporting to smoke. This was followed by those 30 and younger consisting of 21.4% smokers and finally those in the middle with 19.55% reporting they smoked. Of the total number of patients who reported smoking, this broke down to:\n",
    "    34.67% of smokers being 30 or younger\n",
    "    57.3% of smokers being between the ages of 30 and 60\n",
    "    8.03% of smokers being over the age of 60\n",
    "While I predicted that younger generations would have lower rates of smoking, this wasn't quite the case. While equal portions of each age group were smokers, majority of the smokers overall were between the ages of 30 and 60. Those over the age of 60 only accounted for less than 10% of total reported smokers. This, I think, might be due to the fact that smoking can contribute to health issues that would decrease one's overall lifespan. As a portion of smokers die at younger ages, they'd cluster in the mid-age range while their non-smoking counterparts would make up much of the patients in the oldest age group.\n",
